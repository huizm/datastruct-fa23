# datastruct-fa23

The better practice is to **design your data structure and algorithms on the paper before you start to write code**, otherwise your code will be messier and messier when you write it and it will also be less portable.

## hw

### hw 1 Linear list

1. Deletion in contiguous list
2. Insertion in contiguous list
3. Josephus problem (linked list)
4. Classify commodities (linked list)

*hw1-1*, *hw1-2* use contiguous list and *hw1-3*, *hw1-4* use linked list. The generic implementation of linked list is in `LinkedList.c`, `LinkedList.h`.

However, due to the restrictions of the procedure-oriented nature of C, implementing a generic linked list that suits all kinds of data is next to impossible. Therefore, there are linked lists implemented inside those two solutions, respectively. And the "generic" version is just for learning purpose.

### hw 2 Linear list with restricted operations

1. Bracket matching (stack)
2. Pascal's triangle (queue)
3. Train coach rearrangement (queue)
4. Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for pattern searching

## hw 3 Tree and binary tree

1. Traverse thru binary tree
2. Huffman coding
3. Balanced binary search tree
4. Max heap
